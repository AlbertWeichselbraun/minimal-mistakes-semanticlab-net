The goal of this work is to parallelize important text processing tasks
such as Text Preprocessing and Co-occurrence analysis using the hadoop
Map-/Reduce Framework.

-   familiarize yourself with the hadoop map-/reduce framework
-   create a hadoop hello-world application
-   transfer the text cleanup & pre-processing components to map-/redcue
-   transfer the co-occurrence components to map-/reduce
