Introduction
------------

Retrieval Models return and rank documents based on their relevance in
regard to a search query *q*. Popular retrieval models such as the
[Vector Space Model](#salton1975 "wikilink") (VSM) and [Explicit
Semantic Analysis](#gabrilovich2009 "wikilink") (ESA) have numerous
applications in information retrieval, text mining and natural language
processing.

This thesis focuses on

-   the creation of a *Java* library which implements popular retrieval
    models, and
-   the design of a framework for evaluating and comparing these models
    to each other.

Table of Contents

2.  Implementation (VSM, ESA, ...)
    -   Retrieval Models (VSM, ESA, ...)
    -   Evaluation Framework (precision, recall, F1, processing time,
        computational complexity, memory complexity, data storage ..)

3.  Evaluation:
4.  Outlook and Conclusions
