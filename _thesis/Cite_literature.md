Correct citations ensure that your reader can *easily* locate relevant
literature that you used in your thesis.

Master and doctoral thesis should discuss their topic in relation to
state of the art research by including citations to a sufficient number
of related **journal articles** and **recent conference papers** (in
addition to Web resources and books). 

General Information (§1)
========================

All cited literature should be included into the bibliography. If you
use the LaTeX thesis template on the main page together with **\\cite**
and **\\bibliography** commands, LaTeX will correctly format your
bibliography.

If you do not use LaTeX please have a look at the following example
paper and format your citations to match its style.

-   Liu, Wei, Weichselbraun, Albert, Scharl, Arno and Chang, Elizabeth:
    [*Semi-automatic Ontology Extension Using Spreading
    Activation*](http://www.jukm.org/jukm_0_1/semi_automatic_ontology_extension).

Citation Style (§2)
===================

-   If you use numbers to cite literature, always include the author's
    name, if the name is required to properly read the sentence (2.1).

` WRONG:   [1] introduce an ontology extension literature.`  
` CORRECT: Wei et al. [1] introduce an ontology extension literature.`  
` CORRECT: The use of spreading activation is very popular in this area [2,3].`

-   Web sites should be referenced using footnotes, or citations (if the
    particular site is really important). If you cite a lot of Web sites
    please include them in an own section in the bibliography (2.2).

` A Bibliography`  
` A.1 Literature`  
` A.2 Web sites`

-   Citations of whole paragraphs *are not permitted* in the
    thesis (2.3).

` WRONG: Sentence A. Sentence B. [1]`

Figures (§3)
============

-   Provide a citation/source for figure taken from a third
    party source.

Bibliography (§4)
=================

Please keep in mind that a bibliography *helps locating* literature
cited in a paper or thesis.

-   Take care that all entries are complete and contain at least the
    following information (BibTeX will warn you if any of this
    information is missing)
    -   Article: author, title, journal name, number, issue, pages, year
    -   Proceedings: author, title, conference name, location/address,
        pages, year, month
    -   Book: author, title, year, publisher
    -   Incollection: author, title, year, booktitle, editor, pages
    -   Web page: author, title, year, url, last\_access
-   Do not abbreviate journal names in the biography (Comp. Stand. Int.
    -&gt; Computer Standard Interfaces).
