Introduction
============

The amount of information available in the Internet increases
continuously, providing interesting research options that in many
fields, including informatics and social sciences.

Many of these methods are text corpus based and therefore require an
accurate textual representation of the investigated Web pages.
Advertisements, navigational elements and more recently Web 2.0
techniques, considerably complicate the task of extracting the Web
page's content.

*Web content extraction is concerned with extracting the **relevant**
text from Web pages by removing unrelated textual noise like
advertisements, navigational elements, contact and copyright notes.*

The goals of this thesis are to

1.  define requirements for content extraction techniques applicable to
    a search and web analysis tool,
2.  investigate state of the art content extraction techniques, and
3.  implement and test one of those techniques.
