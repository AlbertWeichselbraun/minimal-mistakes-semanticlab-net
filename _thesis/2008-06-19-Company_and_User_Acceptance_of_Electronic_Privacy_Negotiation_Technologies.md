Motivation
==========

Information technology advances are making Internet and Web-based system
use the common choice in many application domains, ranging from business
to health care to scientific collaboration and distance learning.
However, adaption is slowed by well-founded concerns about privacy,
especially given that data collected about individuals is being combined
with information from other sources and analyzed by powerful tools (such
as data mining tools) \[Anton et. al\].

Numerous consumer surveys have revealed that computer users are very
concerned about their privacy online \[Kobsa\]. By publishing privacy
profiles, P3P statements and intelligent choice of interface design
element companies can increase their customers trust in the company's
privacy policy.

This thesis shall (i) investigate possible privacy issues in e-commerce
applications, (ii) describe privacy frameworks and technologies suitable
of protecting the user's privacy, (iii) describe and categorize the
handling of privacy issues and (iv) determine how users respond to
privacy assertion measures.

Tasks
=====

-   Privacy - approaches (normative, privacy-enhanced technology, ...)
-   Describe Frameworks for specifying privacy policies (P3P,
    APPEL, EPAL)
-   Investigate whether companies (e.g. the top 100 Fortune 1000
    companies/austrian top 100, ...) use P3P-profiles and whether they
    correspond to their written counterparts.
    -   classify privacy policies (categories; which ones are used by
        which kind of company?)
    -   compare written privacy policies with their P3P counterparts
-   How is privacy perceived by customers (questionnaire)
    -   determine: how well written are privacy policies
    -   do customers read privacy statements (compare: literature)
    -   do these statements influence their willingness to disclosure
        information
    -   what other site elements affect the customer's trust in the
        company (and its products)
