#### Table of Contents / To Do

-   Introduction
-   Information Extraction (IE)
    -   Definition
    -   Distinction between Information Extraction, Information
        Retrieval, Data Mining, Text Mining
-   Methodology
    -   Present and compare different IE approaches
-   Sequential Probability Models
    -   Theory, Application for IE in combination with trigger phrases
    -   Extensions of Trigger Phrases (Meronymic Relations, ...)
-   Implementation
    -   identify weaknesses in the current trigger phrase implementation
    -   apply and implement a sequential probability model
    -   evaluation

#### Practical points

-   identify weaknesses in the current trigger phrase implementation
-   make use of sequential probability models
-   evaluation of the new approach
