Motivation
==========

New Web standards like Microformats enable Web designers to enrich their
documents with semantic markup. Web authors start adapting Microformats
such as hCal and hReview, thereby enabling Web browsers to automatically
extract and store the annotations. Microformats are embedded into the
content by means of XHTML; their extraction is computationally
expensive, which poses some technical challenges when trying to gather
them from larges samples of Web sites. A tool that is capable of
extracting and storing microformats in a relational database would help
overcome the described problems, and significantly accelerate reasoning
and searching of annotated Web data.

todo
====

-   write a tool capable of
    -   extracting various microformats from Web documents
    -   extract favicons (if present) and \_one\_ representative image
        associated with the Web page
    -   design a database schema for storing annotations
    -   put it all together ;)
