Motivation
==========

In recent years natural language processing techniques and statistical
methods for extracting relevant terms and keywords from Web corpora
(large text of several gigabytes) have gained on importance in many
research fields. The goal of term extraction is to automatically extract
relevant terms from a given corpus. For example, if the extraction
method uses the nouns-only option, it extracts terms like *bicycle* and
*landscape* from the sentence *Experiencing wonderful landscapes with a
bicycle*. Ontology learning for example, a subtask of information
extraction, which is aimed at automatic extraction of relevant concepts
from a given large and structured set of texts facilitates these methods
mentioned above. A method like the one described by [Liu et.
al](#liu2005 "wikilink") is an example.

The aims of this thesis are

1.  to provide an overview over state of the art term extraction
    methods, applicable for web corpora
2.  to implement some of the most promising methods for the extraction
    of the most relevant contents from web sites (for example: only
    retrieving the web contents without advertisment or other
    non-content elements), and
3.  to compare these methods to each other
