Motivation
==========

Mirroring and analysis of sites leveraging Web 2.0 technologies like
AJAX and dynamic HTML pose a serious challenge for current web spider
architectures. Due to dynamic elements modified by JavaScript and
similar technologies, simple HTML-to-text conversion techniques like
lynx and html2text do not deliver usable text representations of Web
documents. New approaches based on more advanced rendering architectures
are required to tackle this problem. This thesis shall investigate to
which extend web browsers can be facilitated to extract *relevant*
content from already rendered Web pages.
