Introduction
============

Information technology advances are making Internet and Web-based system
use the common choice in many application domains, ranging from business
to health care to scientific collaboration and distance learning.
However, adaption is slowed by well-founded concerns about privacy,
especially given that data collected about individuals is being combined
with information from other sources and analyzed by powerful tools (such
as data mining tools) ([Anton2005](#anton2005 "wikilink"))

Numerous consumer surveys have revealed that computer users are very
concerned about their privacy online
([Kobsa2007](#kobsa2007 "wikilink")). By publishing privacy profiles,
P3P statements and intelligent choice of interface design element
companies can increase their customers trust in the company's privacy
policy.

Mozilla Firefox, one of the most popular open source browsers, currently
lacks P3P support. The goals of this thesis was to (i) identify Web
browsing risks, (ii) define requirements for privacy tools, (iii)
evaluate existing privacy tools based on these requiremens, and (iv)
develop and evaluate a privacy plugin for Mozilla Firefox supporting the
P3P standard which is called "Webprivacy" and can be [downloaded
