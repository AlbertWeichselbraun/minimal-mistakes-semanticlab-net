Introduction
------------

The vision of the Geospatial Web combines geographic data, Internet
technology and social change. Geospatial applications like the IDIOM
Media Watch on Climate Change facilitate geo-annotation services to
refine Web pages and media articles with geographic tags.

Identifying the document's target geographies is a rather complex task,
complicated by geo/geo ambiguities (e.g. Vienna/at versus
Vienna/Virginia/us) and geo/non-geo ambiguities like turkey/bird versus
Turkey/country. Most approaches toward tagging the target geography
therefore facilitate machine learning technologies, gazetteers, or a
combination of both to identify geo-tags. The gazetteer's size and many
internal tuning parameter determine the geo-tagger's performance and its
bias towards identifying smaller geographic-entities or higher-level
units. Designing a geo-tagger and choosing these parameters often
involve trade-offs; improvements in one particular area does not
necessarily yield better results in other areas.

The goals of this thesis are

1.  designing a testcase for evaluating geo-taggers
2.  implementing this testcase as a unittest
3.  applying the framework to different approaches towards geo-tagging.
