Network-bound disk encryption allows unlocking LUKS devices (e.g. the encrypted root file system of an Ubuntu server) without entering the password. Instead a Tang server is queried for a key that can be used in conjunction with a private secret to compute the decryption key. As long as the Tang server is available, the disk can be decrypted without the need to manually enter a password.

Ubuntu 20.04 requires the following components for implementing a network-bound disk encryption:

 1. the LUKS encrypted device(s) that should be automatically unlocked. 
 2. a Tang server that provides the public key required by the client for deriving its LUKS decryption key.
 3. Clevis which provides clients that can use a Tang server for unlocking LUKS partitions.
 4. For unlocking a boot device adjustments to initramfs (automatically provided by the `clevis-initramfs` package) are necessary.


# How does network-bound disk encryption work?

The figures below outline how network-bound encryption works. In the first step we use clevis to bind a LUKS encrypted device to a Tang server, generating a secret JSON Web Key (`cJWK`) on the client which is then combined with the server's public key (`sJWK*`) to generate the key (`dJWC`) that is then added to the LUKS device as a decryption key.

Once the device has been bound to the Tang server, it can compute its decryption key with the server's help. The client first generates a ephemeral key (`eJWK`) that is then combined with its secret (`cJWK`) to generate a message (`xJWK`) that is sent to the server. The server combines `xJWK` with its private key `sJWK `to generate the response `yJWK`. Clevis then combines `yJWK `with the server's public key `sJWK`* and `eJWK `to recover the decryption key `dJWK`.

# Setup

Ubuntu 20.04 provides packages for Tang and Clevis which makes installing them straight forward.

## Setup and start the Tang server
Install Tang and Jos√© (an implementation of the JavaScript Object Signing and Encryption standards used by Tang) on the Tang server. 

```bash
apt install tang jose
systemctl enable tangd.socket
systemctl start tangd.socket
``` 
If you install Tang on Ubuntu 18.04 you need to manually generate the Tang keys with `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/tangd-keygen /var/db/tang` before the server start.

Execute `tang-show-keys` to determine the signing key's fingerprint.

```bash
tang-show-keys 
TieDkMgbVKzmXl-uyOfIa0U30lo
``` 

## Host with the encrypted LUKS device(s)
Install Clevis on the host system and then use `clevis luks bind` for binding the device to the Tang server. You need to verify whether the signing key's fingerprint matches 
the one shown on the server and afterwards can agree to binding the LUKS device. Afterwards, Clevis can be used to unlock the device.

Clevis provides plugins for initramfs, dracut, systemd and udisk2 to automize the unlocking process.

```bash
# install clevis
apt install clevis clevis-luks clevis-initramfs clevis-udisks2

# ensure that the device (e.g. vda1) is encrypted and that the tang server is working
cryptsetup luksDump /dev/vda1            # just to be sure that we encrypt the right disk ;)
curl http://192.168.122.1/adv            # verify that the tang server yields a response

# enable clevis tang decryption for luks
clevis luks bind -d /dev/vda1 tang '{"url": "http://192.168.122.1"}'
update-initramfs -u -k 'all'            # reinitialize initramfs to support automatic unlocking of the root device.
```
