This article provides information on issues related to the secure shell
(ssh) including:

1.  using ssh with a jumpserver,
2.  speeding up ssh-connection using multiplexing.

Network Topology
================

The hosts in the inner network (web01, postgres01) are only accessible
through a firewalled gateway. Any direct access to these hosts is
blocked.

```
 yourpc   ---   gate01   ---  web01  
                         \--  postgres01
```

SSH Forwarding
==============

SSH forwarding allows you to connect a port on your computer to any port
accessible from the gateway. Example: You want to connect the postgres
port (5432) on postgres01 to port 2000 on your computer

`ssh user@gate01 -L 2000:postgres01:5432`

Any request to localhost:2000 on `localhost` will now be forwarded to
postgres01 port 5432.

File Transfer
-------------

To transfer a file from yourpc to web01 you've to open a tunnel between
yourpc and the ssh-server of web01

`ssh user@gate01 -L 2000:web01:22`

Afterwards you can copy your file to web01 using scp (by connecting to
port 2000 on your machine):

`scp -P 2000 myfile user@localhost`

Agent forwarding
================

If you use ssh-key based authentication (recommended) you can forward
your ssh-key through gate01 using ssh -A

```bash
 ssh -A user@gate01
 ssh -A user@web01
```

SSH Multiplexing
================

SSH multiplexing speeds up multiple connections to remote hosts by
re-using the existing connection. To use SSH multiplexing put the
following lines in your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```config
 Host *  
   ControlMaster auto   
   ControlPath /tmp/%r@%h:%p
```

Troubleshooting
===============

**Problem**: X11 Forwarding does not work for localhost (*xterm Xt
error: Can't open display; xterm: DISPLAY is not set*) and the message
*error: Failed to allocate internet-domain X11 display socket.* in
`/var/log/auth.log`.

**Solution**

1.  disable IPv6 for ssh (start sshd with the -4 option) by adding
    `SSHD_OPTS=-4` to `/etc/default/ssh` in Ubuntu.
2.  ensure that there is a valid entry for localhost in `/etc/hosts`
    ```
    127.0.0.1       localhost
    ```
